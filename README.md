# Aws-three-tier-architecture-cloud3

This project demonstrates the design and deployment of a highly available, scalable, and secure 3-Tier architecture on AWS, with separate Web, Application, and Database tiers. It was implemented as part of my AWS/DevOps learning journey.

🚀 Architecture Overview
Web Tier: Public-facing EC2 instances behind an External Application Load Balancer (ALB).
Application Tier: Private EC2 instances behind an Internal Load Balancer, running Node.js app with PM2.
Database Tier: Amazon RDS (MySQL) in private subnets, accessible only from the App Tier.


🔧 AWS Services Used
Compute: EC2 (with Auto Scaling Groups)
Database: Amazon RDS (MySQL)
Networking: VPC, Subnets (Public/Private), Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, Route Tables, Security Groups
Storage & IAM: S3 (code storage), IAM Roles/Policies
Traffic Management: Elastic Load Balancers (Internal & External), Route 53 (DNS)
Security & Delivery: ACM (SSL), CloudFront (CDN with HTTPS)


🛠️ Key Configurations
Configured 5 VLANs for segmentation (for CCNA project reference).
Used DHCP and ACLs for VLANs, restricting access and enabling controlled communication.
Deployed CI/CD pipelines with Ansible + GitHub for automation.
Configured health checks (/health) for monitoring EC2 instances.
Applied least-privilege IAM roles for EC2-to-S3 access.


📌 Highlights
Reduced deployment time by 80% with automation.
Achieved secure global delivery using CloudFront + ACM.
Validated end-to-end connectivity (Web → App → DB).
